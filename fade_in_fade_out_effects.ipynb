    "- Audio starts from silence (0) and gradually increases to full volume (1)<br>\n",

    "HOW IT WORKS:\n",
    "- np.linspace(0, 1, samples) creates gradual increase: [0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1]<br>\n",
    "- Multiply audio by this curve to gradually change volume<br>\n",
    "- Linear fade (straight line) - simple and effective<br>\n",

    "WHEN TO USE:\n",
    "- Fade in: Song intros, podcast starts, video begins<br>\n",
    "- Fade out: Song outros, smooth endings<br>\n",
    "- Both: Professional audio production<br>\n",
    "- Short fades (0.5s): Avoid clicks/pops when cutting audio<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Try changing fade_duration:\n",
    "- Longer (3-5 seconds): Slow, dramatic fades<br>\n",
    "- Shorter (0.2-0.5 seconds): Quick, subtle transitions<br>\n"
